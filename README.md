franklin is an exploratory todo application (a la [TodoMVC](todomvc.com)) (slash way for me to learn Flask) that pulls tasks from the [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/start/python.php) and [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/firstapp) APIs.

--WIP--

Presently, sync works both ways for Evernote todos.

With that in mind. . .

**TODO**

- [X] Acquire dev key for Evernote
- [X] Write some API requests to get familiar
- [X] Get previously created todo note from Evernote
- [X] Display contents of todo note
- [X] Format todo contents as html
- [X] Allow user to interact with a todo (using javascript, probably)
- [X] Sync todo status to EN
- [X] Allow non-todo related divs to persist through syncs
- [X] Allow for multiple notes tagged todo
- [X] Get EN functionality working through oAuth
- [ ] Do all that with Google calander
- [ ] Pretty the damn thing up a bit I suppose

Franklin is pseudonym for [microblog](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world/ "Flask Tutorial"), a demo app used to learn Flask made by [Miguel Grinberg](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/author/Miguel%20Grinberg). Since it's all his stuff anyway, I make no claim to original thought!

WIP

---

Okay so once this is over, the plan is to build a todo application (a la [TodoMVC](todomvc.com)) except that I'd like to pull tasks from the [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/start/python.php) and [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/firstapp) APIs.

With that in mind. . .

**TODO**

- [X] Acquire dev key for Evernote
- [X] Write some API requests to get familiar
- [ ] Get previously created todo note from Evernote
- [ ] Display todo status from note
- [ ] Allow user to finish a todo and communicate this to EN
- [ ] Finish the microblog tutorial
- [ ] Move Franklin off of /index
- [ ] Actually build it
